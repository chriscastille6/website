My research bridges rigorous psychological science with practical organizational applications. I focus on understanding how individual differences shape workplace behavior, developing better methods for organizational research, and translating scientific insights into actionable HR strategies.

Below are three interconnected areas that define my scholarly work.

---

<h2 class="research-theme-paid">Personality and Individual Differences (PAID) at Work</h2>

{{< callout >}}
How do individual characteristics—personality traits, values, and abilities—influence workplace outcomes? This research stream examines both the "bright side" (e.g., conscientiousness, meaningful work) and "dark side" (e.g., Machiavellianism, unethical behavior) of personality at work, with a focus on occupational fit and person-environment alignment.
