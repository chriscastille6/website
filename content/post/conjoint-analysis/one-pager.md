title: "Conjoint for Total Rewards: One-Pager"
draft: true

Audience: HR Benefits Consultants / Sales Reps

Problem
- Employers overspend on low-value perks and underinvest in high-impact benefits.
- Leaders need evidence on which options employees truly value and the salary-equivalent WTP.

What we do
- Run a short discrete choice experiment (conjoint) to quantify employee trade-offs among salary, training, manager quality, and flexibility (or your benefits).
- Estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) and attribute importance; map the efficient frontier (best ROI per budget tier).

What you get
- WTP table (salary-equivalent $K) for each benefit.
- Attribute importance chart and efficient frontier figure.
- Budget-tier recommendations (e.g., ≤$1K/employee vs. $3–5K/employee packages).

Why it works
- Based on choice, not stated ratings; aligns budget to what employees value.
- Anchored to salary trade-offs; easy to translate into CFO-ready ROI.

Proof points
- Flexible work and manager quality often have high WTP (see Mas & Pallais, AER; Maestas et al., RAND).
- Sample size heuristics validated via simulation power curves.

Implementation
- Timeline: 2–6 weeks fielding; 1–3 weeks analysis.
- Sample: start with n≈300 (≥200 per key subgroup if segment readouts needed).
- Deliverables: slide deck, WTP and frontier tables, exec summary.

Next steps
- Scoping call to finalize attributes and levels.
- We’ll provide survey links, field, analyze, and present findings.
