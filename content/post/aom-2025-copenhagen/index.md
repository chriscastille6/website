## Introduction: AOM Goes Global

The Academy of Management's 85th Annual Meeting (AOM 2025) marked a historic milestone as the first time the conference was held outside North America. From July 25-29, 2025, nearly 13,000 management scholars, practitioners, and students gathered at Copenhagen's Bella Convention Center to engage with cutting-edge research across the field.

This international expansion underscores the Academy's commitment to building a truly global, inclusive research community. The program featured approximately 4,000 sessions and symposia, along with 900 poster presentations, addressing contemporary topics ranging from artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship to corporate social responsibility, work-life balance, hybrid work arrangements, and employee wellbeing.

Unlike previous years with overarching themes, AOM 2025 embraced diversity by encouraging innovative, research-focused submissions across all divisions. This approach allowed for rich methodological and topical variety, reflecting the multifaceted nature of modern management research.

## Session Highlights: Building Research Credibility

### Enhancing Research Credibility & Transparency (PDW #21939)

**Saturday, July 26, 2025 | 11:00-13:00 CEST | Bella Center, MR5**

Organized by Roman Briker (Maastricht University), Fabiola Heike Gerpott (WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management), and Jost Sieweke (Vrije University Amsterdam), this Professional Development Workshop directly addressed the credibility and integrity crisis in management research.

Alongside Nicolas Bastardoz and Johannes Stark, I presented on practical tools for improving research trustworthiness. The workshop provided hands-on introduction to best practices including:

- **Pre-registration** of research designs and hypotheses
- **Registered reports** for reducing publication bias
- **Causal identification** strategies for stronger inference
- **Better measurement** practices and validation
- **Data sharing** and transparency protocols

The session's key message was clear: building a "credibility community" requires researchers to advocate for these practices systematically. By improving research robustness and transparency, we can increase both policy relevance and the broader impact of management research.

### Collaboration Initiative for Doctoral Students: ARIM Symposium (#20376)

**Sunday, July 27, 2025 | 12:00-13:30 CEST | Bella Center, Hall C – C4-m3**

This symposium introduced the Advancement of Replications Initiative in Management (ARIM), which I'm proud to be part of alongside Andreas Schwab, Xavier Martin, and William Obenauer. The session featured panelists Yannick Griep, Gerdien Sonneveld, Corentin Hericher, and Caitlin C. Belfiore.

ARIM coordinates joint execution and publication of multi-study replications by teams of doctoral students, faculty mentors, and replication-minded scholars. The initiative addresses a critical gap in management research: the need for systematic replication to build evidence-based management theory.

**Key Activities:**
- Brief presentations outlining ARIM's operational model
- Panel discussion exploring replication opportunities and challenges
- Q&A session addressing practical implementation questions



## Methodological Innovation: Advanced Latent Variable Modeling

### Enhancing Model Precision: Advanced Solutions for Common Challenges (#19189)

**Tuesday, July 29, 2025 | 08:30-10:00 CEST | Bella Center, Hall C – C2-m4**

This symposium addressed critical methodological challenges in structural equation modeling (SEM) and latent variable modeling, featuring presentations by Andrew A. Hanna, Larry J. Williams, and Jinsoo Choi. I participated alongside Steven Culpepper, Bo Zhang, Susu Zhang, and Yonguk Park.

**Key Papers Discussed:**

1. **Model Selection Using RMSEA-P Fit Index** (Williams, Culpepper & Castille)
   - Comparison of Traditional vs. Sequential Model Comparison strategies
   - Evidence-based guidance for choosing between approaches

2. **Pseudo-Augmentation Strategy for Underidentification** (Choi & colleagues)
   - Novel method for addressing underidentification in bifactor predictive models
   - Supported by Monte Carlo simulations and empirical examples

3. **Parceling Approaches for Multidimensional Constructs** (Hanna)
   - Examination of how different parceling strategies affect model fit
   - Evidence-based recommendations for practice



## Large-Scale Collaboration: The Science of Team Science

### Navigating Large-Scale Collaborations: Mega-studies, Crowdsourced Research & Massive Meta-Analyses (#11625)

**Sunday, July 27, 2025 | 10:00-12:00 CEST | Bella Center, Hall B – B6-m3**

Organized by Bart De Jong and Kevin M. Kniffin, this PDW explored the "science of team science" and strategies for managing large-scale collaborations. Presenters included Kevin M. Kniffin, Katherine Milkman, George Banks, Piers Steel, and Bart De Jong, with Matthew A. Cronin serving as discussant.

**Session Focus:**
- Managing mega-studies and crowdsourced research projects
- Coordinating massive meta-analyses across multiple teams
- Addressing challenges in authorship, data quality, and resource allocation

**Key Activities:**
- Introductory talks setting the stage for collaboration challenges
- Roundtable discussions where attendees shared experiences
- Report-back sessions synthesizing insights and best practices



## Cross-Cutting Themes: Building a Stronger Research Community

Several interconnected themes emerged across these sessions, reflecting broader trends in management research:

### Transparency & Credibility
Both the research credibility PDW and the ARIM replication symposium emphasized that transparent methods and systematic replication are foundational to trustworthy science. These sessions demonstrated how management research is actively responding to calls for greater robustness and reproducibility.

### Methodological Rigor
The latent variable modeling symposium complemented the credibility theme by addressing technical challenges that, if unresolved, can undermine the validity of findings. The session provided practical tools for enhancing model precision and resolving common methodological issues.

### Collaboration & Scale
The mega-studies PDW and ARIM initiative illustrated how team science and large-scale collaboration can advance knowledge. They also highlighted practical considerations for researchers joining large teams, including coordination strategies and credit allocation protocols.

### Community Building
Several sessions aimed to build research communities—the "credibility community" for transparency practices, the ARIM network for replications, and collaborative networks for large-scale projects. This reflects a growing trend toward collective effort and shared norms in management research.

## Conclusion

AOM 2025 Copenhagen represented a significant milestone in the Academy of Management's history as the first conference held outside North America. The event brought together nearly 13,000 management scholars, practitioners, and students to engage with cutting-edge research across diverse methodological and topical areas.

The sessions documented here—focusing on research credibility, replication initiatives, advanced methodological techniques, and large-scale collaboration—demonstrate the field's commitment to building more robust, transparent, and impactful management research. These initiatives reflect broader trends toward collective effort, shared norms, and enhanced methodological rigor in the management research community.
