I started this lab in 2017, but starting a family, navigating COVID, and getting my research program more well-established meant putting this lab to the side for a while. I enjoyed mentoring students and want to do more of that. Now I'm ready to bring it back to life.

I created PAL to bridge a gap I've observed throughout my career: the distance between rigorous psychological science and the real challenges facing organizations. Too often, academic research sits behind paywalls, written in technical language that HR professionals can't access. Meanwhile, organizations make critical decisions about people—who to hire, how to compensate, when to promote—based more on intuition than evidence. There's something beautiful about using data to understand people at work. Not to reduce them to numbers, but to see patterns we'd otherwise miss. To test our assumptions. To discover what actually drives performance, satisfaction, and retention rather than what we assume drives these outcomes. This is where open science becomes essential.

Open science refers to research practices that enhance the rigor and trustworthiness of our science through transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility (<a href="#castille2022">Castille et al., 2022</a>). Rather than viewing open science as an all-or-nothing approach, we can think of it like visiting a buffet—we can start by adopting one practice that enacts widely shared values like objectivity, honesty, openness, accountability, fairness, and stewardship. Through transparent methods, reproducible analyses, and accessible findings, we can build a body of knowledge that HR professionals can trust and apply. AI can help us implement open science practices by making verifications and reproductions of existing works more feasible. But there's a challenge: simply translating science into practice. As fellow industrial-organizational psychologist Rick Guzzo and I (<a href="#guzzo2024">2024</a>) discussed, translational science—the process of moving research from discovery to application—needs to be accelerated. We need to avoid the ~15 year time lags between science and practice that often plague medicine, where it can take decades before evidence changes practice.

My hope is that sharing my work more openly helps me enact engaged scholarship—do work that matters or shapes practice. Work that moves between theory and practice, between the classroom and the boardroom, between academic rigor and organizational impact. I'm convinced by the vision of the engaged scholar (<a href="#hoffman2021">Hoffman, 2021</a>)—someone who extends their research beyond academic circles to influence public discourse and organizational practice. With the PAL, I'm committed to making the work that we as industrial/organizational psychologists do accessible. I provide case study demonstrations that show how psychological science applies to real organizational problems. I want students to gain access to psychological assessment practices as they pertain to workplace phenomena—to understand how we might study a problem in organizational settings, draw on available research to save ourselves time, and recognize why we often have to challenge our views about people—and ourselves—to make genuine progress in organizing ourselves.

This is part of engaged scholarship: putting students in touch with local professionals is one way to accelerate translational science—moving research from discovery to application. That's why I'm partnering with <a href="https://www.bayoushrm.org">Bayou SHRM</a> to build a mentoring program that helps our top HR students receive mentoring from experienced, local professionals—and both learn about how to best apply what are commonly studied as high-performance work practices (<a href="#combs2006">Combs, Liu, Hall, & Ketchen, 2006</a>). These practices—which include selective hiring, extensive training, performance-based pay, and employee involvement—have been shown to improve organizational performance, particularly in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) where our local organizations often operate. Recent meta-analytic evidence confirms that high-performance work practices are effective in SMEs as well, making them particularly relevant for our regional context (<a href="#hansen2025">Hansen, Usanova, & Geraudel, 2025</a>). But understanding which practices work is only part of the equation—we also need to understand how to measure their impact and make data-driven decisions about people. This is where people analytics comes in.

## **What is People Analytics?**

People analytics applies data science, statistical methods, and behavioral science to understand and improve how organizations manage their workforce. This field requires diverse competencies. A study of job postings for people analysts and HR analysts revealed six core competency areas (<a href="#mccartney2021">McCartney, Murphy, & Mccarthy, 2021</a>): consulting, technical knowledge, data fluency and data analysis, HR and business acumen, research and discovery, and storytelling and communication. As McCartney et al. note, these competencies reflect the evolving role of HR analysts who must blend technical expertise with business insight and communication skills.

This chart shows Google search interest for five HR-related terms from 2004 to 2025. Notice how "people analytics" has dramatically outpaced "HR analytics" since around 2015. This isn't just semantic preference. It reflects a fundamental shift—from administrative HR functions to strategic, people-centered analytics. From compliance and record-keeping to prediction and optimization. From intuition to evidence. The field has grown remarkably over the past two decades. What began as basic workforce reporting has evolved into sophisticated predictive modeling, experimental design, and organizational network analysis.

<div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
{{< figure src="featured.png" width="120%" >}}
</div>

But here's an important distinction: people analytics and evidence-based management are not the same thing. As <a href="#briner">Briner (2019)</a> has noted, people analytics is one piece of taking an evidence-based approach—but not the only piece. People analytics encompasses the full spectrum of bringing evidence into organizational decision-making, integrating operational planning, research-based insights, consulting skills, and data science. Not all sets of data need to be gathered or generated, and not all analyses on one's available data need to be conducted to make progress. Rather, the two inform each other. When analysts are conscientious, explicit, and judicious in their use of the best available evidence from multiple sources to make decisions, they are practicing evidence-based management (<a href="#briner">Briner, 2019</a>). Sometimes that comes from our own organization's data. Other times it comes from other sources—published research, industry benchmarks, or insights from similar organizations. To make this point more salient, let's consider an interesting and widespread problem: why do people quit?

## **An Example of The Kinds of Problems People Analysts Address: Employee Turnover**

Turnover—when employees leave an organization—is one of the most costly and disruptive problems organizations face. The financial implications are substantial: research has documented that the cost of employee turnover can range from 1–2x an employee's annual salary, depending on the role and industry ([Boudreau, Cascio, & Fink, 2019](#boudreau2019)). But turnover isn't just expensive. It disrupts teams, erodes institutional knowledge, and can create cascading effects throughout an organization.

Meta-analytic research has identified various predictors of turnover, from job satisfaction and organizational commitment to job search behavior and alternative job opportunities ([Griffeth, Hom, & Gaertner, 2000](#griffeth2000); [Hom, Mitchell, Lee, & Griffeth, 2012](#hom2012)). Some of these factors relate to content that I find particularly interesting—personality and individual differences. For example, conscientiousness and emotional stability are consistently related to turnover intentions, while other traits like openness to experience may predict different types of career moves ([Zimmerman, 2008](#zimmerman2008)). If our goal is to control turnover costs, then looking at salient factors that are controllable from an organizational perspective are worth considering—fit for the role, leadership quality, compensation structures, and work-life balance.

But there's another factor worth considering: do people sometimes quit because their coworkers quit? This is what's commonly referred to as "turnover contagion." When a coworker leaves, does it increase your own likelihood of leaving? Research suggests yes—and the effect can be cumulative. When multiple coworkers in your network leave, your turnover risk increases substantially. This is where organizational network analysis becomes powerful for understanding how relationships and connections within an organization influence behavior and outcomes.

Where I can be helpful is in helping a team consider a more holistic perspective. Sometimes you have the data you need to answer a question. Sometimes you don't. The key is knowing when to gather new data, when to analyze existing data, and when to draw on what the broader research literature tells us.

I'm unapologetic about using AI to swiftly turn ideas into testable realities. This blog post, the website, and most of the materials available here were drafted with assistance from Cursor AI. AI can help us in multiple ways: by quickly synthesizing research findings, identifying relevant studies, and helping analysts navigate the vast literature to find the most applicable evidence for their specific organizational context; by facilitating the use of our own intellect, as <a href="#mollick2024">Mollick (2024)</a> discusses in *Co-intelligence*; and by getting through the drudgery of work—getting code to run, getting output that should make sense, having a process that is auditable. This is what it means to use AI as what Mollick calls "co-intelligence"—not replacing our thinking, but augmenting it. The tools we use—whether AI-assisted code generation, automated data analysis, or intelligent research assistants—are means to an end: better science, faster iteration, and more accessible insights. AI can help us be wrong faster, and what is learning if not being wrong? We can experiment, get feedback, and improve over time. AI can be used thoughtfully or thoughtlessly, but when used thoughtfully, it accelerates our ability to iterate, test hypotheses, and refine our understanding. What matters isn't the tool, but the rigor of the methods, the validity of the findings, and the impact on practice.

Consider turnover contagion: when a coworker leaves, does it increase your own likelihood of leaving? Research suggests yes—and the effect can be cumulative. When multiple coworkers in your network leave, your turnover risk increases substantially ([Felps et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2009.41331075); [Wang, Newman, & Dipboye, 2016](https://doi.org/10.5465/ambpp.2016.82)). This is where **organizational network analysis (ONA)**—the study of how relationships and connections within an organization influence behavior and outcomes—becomes powerful.

In research led by my colleague Scott Hines—a former Louisiana Tech Bulldog, then at Allstate Insurance Company, now Senior Research Scientist at Amazon Web Services—he collected and examined organizational network data from over 5,000 employees ([Hines, Castille, & Castille, 2019](#hines2019)). I helped him work toward publication of this research. He mapped each employee's connections within the organization, then tracked how coworker departures influenced their own turnover decisions. An important methodological challenge in this work was distinguishing turnover contagion from homophily—the tendency for similar people to associate with each other (birds of a feather flock together). Indeed, our data could not fully differentiate these two influences, which in part explains why this paper wasn't published. While we strive to make everything open and accessible, this must be done within reason—we don't want to place anyone at risk by sharing information that could be identifying or harmful.

<p>The results were striking: the odds of an employee turning over increase by approximately 2.1x for every connection that has left, and the effect compounds dramatically—losing multiple connections created cascading turnover risks that could destabilize entire teams or departments.</p>

<p>This bar chart illustrates how turnover compounds as people leave. Employees with no departing connections have a baseline risk (1x), while those with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 connections who have left face 1.7x, 3.3x, 5.0x, 6.6x, and 8.3x increases in turnover probability, respectively.</p>

    <p>This network view illustrates the interconnected nature of turnover decisions. Employees don't leave in isolation—their departures send ripples through their social networks.</p>
    <p>The network reveals how turnover can spread through social ties, with central employees having greater influence on contagion effects. When turnover spreads through networks, these costs multiply rapidly.</p>

  </div>
</div>

The network reveals how turnover can spread through social ties, with central employees having greater influence on contagion effects. When turnover spreads through networks, these costs multiply rapidly. Organizations can use network analysis to identify employees at high risk of turnover contagion and intervene proactively—perhaps through targeted retention efforts, team restructuring, or addressing underlying issues that drive departures.

This is the kind of problem we work with at PAL. Not abstract theoretical questions, but real challenges that organizations face every day. We help teams understand when they have the data they need to answer a question, when they need to gather new data, and when they should draw on what the broader research literature tells us. It's about bringing the right tools—whether that's network analysis, predictive modeling, experimental design, or meta-analytic insights—to bear on problems that matter.

## **PAL's Three Research Themes**

PAL pursues three interconnected research streams, each designed to advance both science and practice:

<div class="row" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Personality and Individual Differences at Work (PAID @ Work)</h3>
    <p>We study how individual characteristics—personality traits, values, abilities—shape workplace behavior and outcomes. This includes examining both the "bright side" (conscientiousness, meaningful work, occupational fit) and the "dark side" (Machiavellianism, unethical behavior) of personality at work (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-016-3079-9">Castille, Buckner, & Thoroughgood, 2018</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.109569">Simonet & Castille, 2020</a>).</p>
    <p>We're adapting occupational fit tests to help students discover educational and career opportunities unique to South Louisiana.</p>
    <p>We're also developing an emotional intelligence assessment to help college students build strengths across different facets of emotional intelligence, drawing on established frameworks from Mayer and Salovey's four-branch model and ability-based measures of workplace emotional intelligence (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000365">Schlegel & Mortillaro, 2019</a>).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Organizational Research Methods</h3>
    <p>We develop and validate better approaches to organizational research, including open science practices that increase transparency and reproducibility, and techniques for understanding and controlling method variance (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/S0742-730120240000042005">Castille & Williams, 2024</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-022-09806-2">Castille et al., 2022</a>). Better methods yield better science, which yields better practice.</p>
    <p>We use simulation methods to understand how people respond to surveys and under what conditions we can trust the findings emerging from our research. This work, conducted with <a href="#williams2024">Larry Williams</a>, helps us understand when survey responses are reliable and when they might be compromised by various response biases or methodological artifacts. Simulation also augments my teaching practice—I've built simulations to help students use effective performance management practices, and I've co-taught with colleagues in other departments using total rewards optimization exercises that help students see how economic concepts apply to management challenges, such as employee retention.</p>
    <p>I'm co-founder and executive team member of the <a href="https://www.arimweb.org">Advancement of Replications Initiative in Management (ARIM)</a>, leading <a href="https://www.arimweb.org/replications-initiative/s1-the-dark-side-of-goal-setting">Project 1—The Dark Side of Goal Setting</a>—a global study examining whether goals cause individuals to engage in unethical behaviors. Our team of international scholars is investigating this question through exact and constructive replications of <a href="https://doi.org/10.5465/20159596">Schweitzer, Ordóñez, & Douma (2004)</a>. This work exemplifies what <a href="#kreamer2024">Kreamer, Cobb, Castille, & Cogswell (2024)</a> describe as big team science initiatives—collaborative efforts that facilitate large sample theory testing, resource sharing, and trustworthy scientific advancement.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">People Strategy and Tactics</h3>
    <p>We apply rigorous analytics to real-world HR challenges: attrition modeling, compensation strategy, high-performance work practices, and demonstrating return on investment (ROI) through utility analysis. This is where theory meets practice, where models become tools, where research creates impact. We draw on foundational work in utility analysis, including <a href="#sturman2001">Sturman's (2001)</a> advances in calculating the value of selection procedures and HR interventions, as well as his <a href="#sturman2003">2003</a> work on quantifying the value of HR interventions.</p>
    <p>Importantly, <a href="#sturman2012">Sturman (2012)</a> called for more attention to be devoted to teaching utility analysis—recognizing that while the method is powerful, it needs to be more accessible to students and HR professionals. This is something I've taken upon myself to do. I'm creating an open-source human resource information system (HRIS) for students to practice interacting with and using HR data to drive organizational decision-making and execute strategy. I'm also working to make utility analysis more accessible through several web applications developed based on scholars' published works:</p>

## **For Our Students**

If you're a student at Nicholls State University—or anywhere else—considering a career in people analytics, here's what you need to know.

Want to assess whether this career path aligns with your preferences? Try our [People Analytics Fit Assessment](/assessments/people-analytics-fit/)—a comprehensive assessment based on [Liu et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0001232) that measures your fit across interests, values, knowledge, skills, and personality. This assessment is specifically designed for college students interested in People Analytics careers and provides detailed feedback on how your profile relates to different career outcomes (career satisfaction, job satisfaction, income potential, etc.).

## **Humility, Learning, and Embracing Imperfection**

There's a wonderful video of James Randi talking about what happens when people get a PhD. The humor comes from recognizing how advanced degrees can sometimes inflate our sense of certainty—when in reality, we should be more humble about what we know and don't know. This isn't just a joke; it's a profound truth about the scientific process.

Science advances not through certainty, but through debate, argument, and ideally, consensus. <a href="#latham1988">Latham, Erez, & Locke (1988)</a> demonstrated this beautifully when they resolved a scientific dispute by the joint design of crucial experiments by the antagonists. Rather than continuing to argue from entrenched positions, they worked together to design studies that could actually answer their questions. That's how science should work—not as a battle of egos, but as a collaborative search for truth.

This humility is essential for effective people analytics and change management. No change effort is perfect. No analysis is flawless. No intervention works exactly as planned. Embracing imperfection—recognizing that we'll make mistakes, that our models will be wrong, that our predictions will miss the mark—isn't a weakness. It's a strength. It's what allows us to learn, to iterate, to improve.

What is learning if not being wrong? AI can help us be wrong faster. I believe we can accelerate science with AI, and I'm not alone in this view (<a href="#science2024">Science Editorial, 2024</a>; <a href="#banks2025">Van Quaquebeke, Tonidandel, & Banks, 2025</a>). Rather than seeing AI as a threat to scientific rigor, we should recognize it as a tool that can help us iterate more quickly, test hypotheses more efficiently, and learn from our mistakes more rapidly. As <a href="#banks2025">Van Quaquebeke, Tonidandel, & Banks (2025)</a> discuss, AI will reshape scientific inquiry and the publication process—not just by making things more efficient, but by fundamentally changing how we approach research questions and scientific communication. When learning to dance, you don't read a book and then hit a perfect move on the first try. You experiment. You get feedback. You improve over time. I know this from experience—I used to perform with The Cadets, a world championship organization. We won in 2005, and I led the organization from 2006 to 2008. I can appreciate the value of learning and having teachers who help you learn. The same principle applies to using AI thoughtfully—it requires practice, feedback, and continuous improvement.

## **What "In the Weeds" Means**

*"In the Weeds" is the official blog of the People Analytics Lab of the Bayou.* [Subscribe to stay updated](/post/) on our latest research insights and analyses.

This blog is called "In the Weeds" for a reason.

We'll dive deep into specific research questions, analytical techniques, and practical applications. We'll show our work—the code, the methods, the reasoning. We'll share both successes and failures, because that's how science progresses.

Some posts will be technical. Others will be conceptual. All will aim to illuminate something interesting about people at work—patterns in personality data, effects of compensation structures, nuances of statistical methods, insights from organizational networks.

We invite you into the weeds with us. That's where the interesting work happens.

## **Why I Do This Work**

I was trained to be a consultant and tried that work for a time. But I genuinely love learning things that others overlook and finding ways to share that with others, which is why I'm an academic. This job gives me the space to do what I love to do—to dig into questions that matter, to discover patterns in data that others might miss, to translate complex research into insights that can actually help people and organizations. AI helps me do it more impactfully and intelligently. After all, I'm a busy guy—I'm married, have four kids (oldest is 6), just moved into a new home, and often have to juggle doing all the things work-wise while making sure my kids don't burn the house down. AI doesn't replace my thinking or my passion for the work. It amplifies it. It helps me get through the tedious parts so I can focus on what matters—the questions, the insights, the impact.

## **Partner with Us**

Whether you're a student exploring career options, an HR professional building analytics capabilities, an organizational leader seeking evidence-based insights, or simply someone curious about what data reveals about people at work—welcome.

This is an academic project, yes. But it's academic work in service of real problems, real organizations, and real people. It's scholarship that engages with the world rather than retreating from it.

That's the vision for the People Analytics Lab of the Bayou.

Stay tuned as we share our research, develop new tools, and explore what it means to study people in organizational life with rigor, humility, and a commitment to making work better.
