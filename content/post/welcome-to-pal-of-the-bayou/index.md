## Why I'm Building This Website

Welcome to the People Analytics Lab of the Bayou! I'm launching this website to make my research and teaching resources more accessible to the public, students, and fellow scholars. As someone who studies people in organizations, I'm passionate about understanding—and helping others understand—the complex dynamics that drive workplace behavior and effectiveness.

### My Teaching Philosophy

> I take it as my personal responsibility to expose students to evidence-based management (EBM; Barends & Rousseau, 2018) so that they might make wiser decisions as employees, managers, and business leaders. In my classes, we discuss the most credible science available on various topics, weighing scientific evidence against our own experiences and the views of professionals, and ultimately considering how best to act given this information. My goal is to help students cultivate an attitude of wisdom—acting with the best information on hand while doubting what they believe to be true (Erez & Grant, 2014).

EBM is about making decisions through the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. I strive to be a role model of evidence-based decision making, helping students see how to acquire and use information to make decisions in organizational settings.

My pedagogy is informed by integrating key sources of information: my colleagues, my students, and the peer-reviewed literature on effective teaching practices. I use a variety of tactics, such as signaling flexibility and availability, assigning weekly preparation participation assignments, using team-based teaching and charters, leveraging pre-course surveys to connect with student interests, reaching out to struggling students, clarifying the value of active learning, reframing mistakes as learning opportunities, and encouraging peer review and writing support. My courses are designed to help students not only master content but also develop practical skills for their future careers.

### Research, Technology, and Open Science

I specialize in building computer simulations, which allows me to create interactive, data-driven tools for both research and pedagogy. One of my goals is to help students grasp challenging concepts—like evaluating the utility of HR interventions—by making abstract ideas tangible. For example, I'm developing apps that generate organic organizational data based on decisions students make in the Interpretive Simulations HRManagement simulation. This approach helps students see the direct connection between their choices and outcomes such as voluntary turnover, morale, and productivity (Guzzo, 2022).

I am also a leader in the open science movement, which aims to make research more transparent, reproducible, and replicable. My work has focused on advocating for open science practices and integrating them into my own research pipeline. Currently, I serve on the executive team for the Advancement of Replications Initiative in Management (ARIM, [arimweb.org](https://arimweb.org)), specifically on a project examining the dark side of goal setting. Through ARIM, we implement open science practices to benefit our research and to train the next generation of doctoral students.

### Looking Ahead

This website will serve as a hub for sharing my research, teaching tools, and open science initiatives. I hope it will help students, practitioners, and researchers engage more deeply with people analytics and organizational science.
