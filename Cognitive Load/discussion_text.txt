No worries – I decided to make the app anyway.

Cognitive Load Analysis Tool
christopher-m-castille.shinyapps.io

You can insert new text input and get a comprehensive analysis.
If something seems off, let me know.

Hi Chris,
Okay, there is an error when I run the code, and I'm sure I did something wrong. The error reads: " Error: corpus() only works on
character, corpus, Corpus, data.frame, kwic objects." If you don't have any time to help further, it is totally okay. I understand things are
busy!

That should work. Let me know if it doesn’t.

Hi Chris,
I hope you had an awesome trip. Wow, this is great! Thank you so much for running these analyses for us. I appreciate your
feedback.
I can see that this would be very helpful for experiments in the future (especially to further demonstrate equality across conditions),
and I would be curious about the web app. I opened the codebook in R Studio—would I just need to change the Christian values and
non-Christian values text in the code to re-run the analysis? Thank you so much!

Hi Juliann,
I played around with your work a bit and can see the point that the reviewer is making in this case. It's probably fair to state that
non-traditional (liberal?) values are more sophisticated or complex and nuanced. Naturally, cognitive load will be higher for text
reflecting these values, so equating the text on for different values statements on cognitive load may be necessary to minimize the
influence of a confound (here, verbal ability, which I’m suspecting would also be associate with a more liberal orientation).
I used AI (Cursor) to both measure cognitive load using standard R packages for doing so and create new alternatives worth
considering further (about 30). I was able to find a text sample that minimizes cognitive load but you may wish to play with it some
more. I created a codebook for measuring and assessing cognitive load (it's in R). If you prefer, the HTML file contains what you
need (no need to use Rin that case). If you like, I can probably give you a web app that helps you to play with different language
sets and assess readability – just let me know. Alternatively, Microsoft Word contains some readability indices that you can use but
if you want R’s functionality or reproducibility, I can help with that.
I hope this helps but if you need more, please let me know.

Hi Chris,
Thank you for being willing to look at our experimental conditions! Each participant will see one of the two conditions, and all
participants will then see the section titled "prompt" appear after seeing one of the two conditions. We've attached a document
with the conditions.
The reviewer wants each condition to require the same cognitive load and be semantically similar. Also, any piece of information

The reviewer wants each condition to require the same cognitive load and be semantically similar. Also, any piece of information
that is exclusive to one condition must relate directly to the theoretical contribution. I understand what the reviewer wants, but I
am not as skilled when it comes to putting the condition on paper. So, I appreciate you looking at these for us. I have copied my
co-author on the email to keep her in the loop.

Thanks so much, Chris! How about the Saturday after you get back for the deadline? I appreciate your willingness to take a
look at it. Congratulations on your presentation!

Hi Chris,
I hope you've had an awesome summer! I have a favor to ask of you. My colleague and I have been offered a chance to
redo a study for a manuscript that is under review. Our study contains two experimental conditions. The reviewer and
editor are not happy with the way the experimental conditions were written the first time we ran the study, as they argue
that additional information in one of the conditions is confounding. My colleague and I are going to rewrite the conditions
to rerun the study, and I was wondering if you would be able to take a quick look at the rewritten conditions to offer
feedback before we spend additional money to run the study. The conditions are not very long (less than five minutes to
read both of them), and I would provide the original conditions we had so that you can see what the reviewer is talking
about. Given your background, I thought you would be great to ask! We can send them to you in the next few days.
Would you be willing to take a look?
