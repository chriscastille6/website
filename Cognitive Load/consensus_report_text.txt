Differences in linguistic complexity between experimental conditions generally lead
to increased cognitive load for participants and can negatively impact response
validity, especially for individuals with lower cognitive abilities or in more
demanding tasks.
1. Introduction
The relationship between linguistic complexity, cognitive load, and response validity is a central concern in
psychological research, particularly in the design and interpretation of experimental tasks and assessments.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that increasing linguistic complexity—through longer sentences, more
abstract vocabulary, or complex syntactic structures—tends to elevate cognitive load, as measured by both
subjective and objective indicators such as response times, self-reported effort, and physiological measures like
EEG and pupil dilation (Cohen et al., 2021; Castro-Meneses et al., 2019; Demberg & Sayeed, 2016; Just et al., 1996;
Vogelzang et al., 2020). This heightened cognitive load can, in turn, affect the validity of participant responses, with
evidence suggesting that individuals with lower cognitive abilities or higher anxiety are disproportionately affected
by complex language, leading to slower responses and potentially less accurate or less valid data (Cohen et al.,
2021; Güvendir & Uzun, 2023; Sung et al., 2020; Révész et al., 2015). Experimental manipulations of linguistic
complexity have shown robust effects on cognitive processing across modalities (e.g., reading, listening, writing)
and populations (e.g., native speakers, L2 learners, individuals with cognitive impairments) (Lee, 2018; Révész et al.,
2017; Brunfaut & Révész, 2015; Shain et al., 2021; Sung et al., 2020; Awwad & Tavakoli, 2019; Xu et al., 2021; Cho,
2018; Kim et al., 2015). However, the impact on response validity is nuanced, with some studies indicating that
increased complexity primarily affects processing speed and effort rather than the accuracy of responses, while
others highlight the risk of reduced data quality in more demanding conditions (Cohen et al., 2021; Révész et al.,
2015; Embretson, 2023; Hunter, 2021). The literature also underscores the importance of considering individual
differences (e.g., working memory, language proficiency, anxiety) and task characteristics (e.g., modality, support,
genre) when evaluating the effects of linguistic complexity on cognitive load and response validity (Révész et al.,
2017; Awwad & Tavakoli, 2019; Güvendir & Uzun, 2023; Cho, 2018; Kim et al., 2015; Yoon, 2021; Li et al., 2024).
Overall, the evidence supports a strong link between linguistic complexity, cognitive load, and the potential for
compromised response validity, emphasizing the need for careful task design in psychological research.

2. Methods
A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Consensus, which aggregates over 170 million research
papers from sources including Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy involved 21 targeted queries
across 8 search groups, focusing on linguistic complexity, cognitive load, and response validity in psychological
research. In total, 1,051 papers were identified, 592 were screened, 379 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most
relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results
3.1. Effects of Linguistic Complexity on Cognitive Load
Multiple studies confirm that increasing linguistic complexity—such as longer sentences, more abstract words, or
complex syntax—leads to higher cognitive load, as evidenced by longer response times, increased self-reported
effort, and physiological markers (e.g., EEG theta power, pupil dilation) (Cohen et al., 2021; Castro-Meneses et al.,
2019; Demberg & Sayeed, 2016; Just et al., 1996; Vogelzang et al., 2020). These effects are robust across modalities
(reading, listening, writing) and are particularly pronounced in individuals with lower cognitive abilities or higher
anxiety (Cohen et al., 2021; Güvendir & Uzun, 2023; Sung et al., 2020; Révész et al., 2015; Shain et al., 2021; Awwad
& Tavakoli, 2019; Cho, 2018; Kim et al., 2015; Mavrou, 2020).
3.2. Impact on Response Validity
While increased cognitive load due to linguistic complexity often results in slower responses, the impact on
response validity (i.e., the accuracy and interpretability of responses) is more nuanced. Some studies report that
validity is not necessarily compromised within plausible response ranges, but others find that data quality can
suffer, especially for participants with lower cognitive resources or in high-demand tasks (Cohen et al., 2021;
Révész et al., 2015; Embretson, 2023; Hunter, 2021; Yoon, 2021). The risk of invalid or less reliable responses
increases as cognitive demands outpace participant capacity.

2 / 9

3.3. Individual Differences and Moderators
Individual factors such as working memory, language proficiency, and anxiety significantly moderate the effects of
linguistic complexity on cognitive load and response validity (Révész et al., 2017; Awwad & Tavakoli, 2019; Güvendir
& Uzun, 2023; Cho, 2018; Kim et al., 2015; Li et al., 2024; Mavrou, 2020). For example, high working memory
capacity can buffer the negative effects of complex language, while high anxiety or low proficiency can exacerbate
them.
3.4. Measurement and Methodological Considerations
Subjective cognitive load questionnaires are generally reliable, but their validity can be affected by translation, item
formulation, and participant understanding (Krieglstein et al., 2022; Krieglstein et al., 2023). Objective measures
(e.g., EEG, pupil dilation) provide convergent evidence but may differ in sensitivity to complexity manipulations
(Castro-Meneses et al., 2019; Demberg & Sayeed, 2016). Dual-task paradigms and response time modeling are
effective for validating cognitive load manipulations and assessing their impact on response processes (Lee, 2018;
Dutilh et al., 2018; Révész et al., 2015; Engonopoulos, 2013; Embretson, 2023; Hunter, 2021).

4. Discussion
The literature provides strong evidence that linguistic complexity is a significant driver of cognitive load in
psychological research tasks, with clear implications for response validity. The most robust findings indicate that
increased complexity leads to longer response times, higher self-reported effort, and greater neural activation,
especially in language-selective brain regions (Cohen et al., 2021; Castro-Meneses et al., 2019; Demberg & Sayeed,
2016; Just et al., 1996; Vogelzang et al., 2020). While some studies suggest that response validity (accuracy) may be
preserved within certain bounds, others highlight the risk of compromised data quality, particularly for participants
with lower cognitive resources or in high-demand conditions (Cohen et al., 2021; Révész et al., 2015; Embretson,
2023; Hunter, 2021; Yoon, 2021). The reliability of subjective cognitive load measures is generally high, but their
validity can be affected by translation and item formulation, underscoring the need for careful instrument design
and validation (Krieglstein et al., 2022; Krieglstein et al., 2023). Objective measures such as EEG and pupil dilation
offer valuable convergent evidence but may differ in sensitivity and practicality (Castro-Meneses et al., 2019;
Demberg & Sayeed, 2016). Individual differences—such as working memory, language proficiency, and anxiety—
play a critical role in moderating the effects of linguistic complexity, suggesting that task design should account for
participant variability to ensure valid and interpretable results (Révész et al., 2017; Awwad & Tavakoli, 2019;
Güvendir & Uzun, 2023; Cho, 2018; Kim et al., 2015; Li et al., 2024; Mavrou, 2020). Overall, the research
underscores the importance of aligning linguistic complexity with participant abilities and research goals to
optimize both cognitive load and response validity.

5. Conclusion
In summary, the literature strongly supports that differences in linguistic complexity between experimental
conditions increase participant cognitive load and can negatively impact response validity, particularly for
individuals with lower cognitive abilities or in more demanding tasks. The effects are robust across modalities and
populations, but are moderated by individual differences and task characteristics. Careful task and instrument
design, as well as consideration of participant variability, are essential for optimizing both cognitive load and
response validity in psychological research.
5.1. Research Gaps
Despite substantial evidence, gaps remain in understanding the nuanced effects of linguistic complexity on
response validity across diverse populations, task types, and real-world settings. There is also a need for more
research on the interplay between cognitive load, motivation, and affect, as well as the development of more
sensitive and universally valid measurement tools.
